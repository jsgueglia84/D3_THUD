# Diablo III and TurboHUD

This simple tool starts Diablo III and TurboHUD at once.

1. Launch Diablo III's exe which launch Battle.net (by default)
1. Once the Battle.net app is launched, the tool clicks on Play (Carefull here, you **MUST** have Diablo III selected in the left pannel by default or else the tool will launch the default game and will hang in a loop)
1. Once DIablo III's process is launched, it wait 5 seconds then launch TurboHUD and shuts itself down.

## How to use it?

1. Open the project in Visual Studio and compile it, or use the comp√Æled version found [here](https://github.com/yonguelink/D3_THUD/blob/master/D3_ThudLauncher.exe)
1. Create a new user in Windows that does NOT have admin privileges, and is locked from accessing TurboHUD's folder

	* Execute Diablo's launcher and in the settings make sure the game will be launched in 32 bit (as TurboHUD doesn't support 64 bit, and might never)

	1. TurboHUD complete path (by default : D:\THUD\THUD.exe)
	1. Diablo III complete path (by default: C:\Program File\Diablo III\Diablo III.exe)
	1. The user name which should run Diablo (by default: diablo)
	1. The password for that user (by default: diablo)
1. You can run the executable using CMD or create a shortcut
1. To Create the shortcut

	1. Right click on the shortcut and click on `Properties`
